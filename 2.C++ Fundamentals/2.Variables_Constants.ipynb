    "Let's imagine that I ask you to remember the number 5, and then I ask you to also memorize the number 2 at the same time. You have just stored two different values in your memory (5 and 2). Now, if I ask you to add 1 to the first number I said, you should be retaining the numbers 6 (that is 5+1) and 2 in your memory. Then we could, for example, subtract these values and obtain 4 as result.\n",
    "The whole process described above is a simile of what a computer can do with two variables. The same process can be expressed in C++ with the following set of statements:\n",

    "We can now define variable as a portion of memory to store a value.\n",
    "Each variable needs a name that identifies it and distinguishes it from the others. For example, in the previous code the variable names were a, b, and result, but we could have called the variables any names we could have come up with, as long as they were valid C++ identifiers."

What the program needs to be aware of is the kind of data stored in the variable. It's not the same to store a simple integer as it is to store a letter or a large floating-point number; even though they are all represented using zeros and ones, they are not interpreted in the same way, and in many cases, they don't occupy the same amount of memory.\n",

    "* __Numerical integer types__: They can store a whole number value, such as 7 or 1024. They exist in a variety of sizes, and can either be signed or unsigned, depending on whether they support negative values or not. \n",
    "* __Floating-point types__: They can represent real values, such as 3.14 or 0.01, with different levels of precision, depending on which of the three floating-point types is used. \n",
