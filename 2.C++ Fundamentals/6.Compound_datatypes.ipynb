    "## Arrays\n",
    "An array is a series of elements of the same type placed in contiguous memory locations that can be individually referenced by adding an index to a unique identifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "That means that, for example, five values of type int can be declared as an array without having to declare 5 different variables (each with its own identifier). Instead, using an array, the five int values are stored in contiguous memory locations, and all five can be accessed using the same identifier, with the proper index.\n",
    "For example, an array containing 5 integer values of type int called foo could be represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "![array1](../static/img/arrays1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "where each blank panel represents an element of the array. In this case:\n",
    "\n",
    "* these are values of type int. \n",
    "* these elements are numbered from 0 to 4, being 0 the first and 4 the last; In C++, the first element in an array is always numbered with a zero (not a one), no matter its length.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like a regular variable, an array must be declared before it is used. A typical declaration for an array in C++ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "    type name [elements];\n",
    "    \n",
    "where type is a valid type (such as int, float...), name is a valid identifier and the elements field (which is always enclosed in square brackets []), specifies the length of the array in terms of the number of elements.\n",
    "Therefore, the foo array, with five elements of type int, can be declared as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "int foo [5];\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    ">NOTE: The elements field within square brackets [], representing the number of elements in the array, must be a constant expression, since arrays are blocks of static memory whose size must be determined at compile time, before the program runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initializing arrays\n",
    "By default, regular arrays of local scope (for example, those declared within a function) are left uninitialized. This means that none of its elements are set to any particular value; their contents are undetermined at the point the array is declared.\n",
    "But the elements in an array can be explicitly initialized to specific values when it is declared, by enclosing those initial values in braces {}. For example:"
