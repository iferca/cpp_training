Therefore, using is more generic, although typedef has a longer history and is probably more common in existing code.\n",

That means that the type of myword above, declared with type WORD, can as well be considered of type unsigned int; it does not really matter, since both are actually referring to the same type.\n",
    "Type aliases can be used to reduce the length of long or confusing type names, but they are most useful as tools to abstract programs from the underlying types they use. For example, by using an alias of int to refer to a particular kind of parameter instead of using int directly, it allows for the type to be easily replaced by long (or some other type) in a later version, without having to change every instance where it is used."
