    "Where class_name is a valid identifier for the class, object_names is an optional list of names for objects of this class. The body of the declaration can contain members, which can either be data or function declarations, and optionally access specifiers.\n",
    "Classes have the same format as plain data structures, except that they can also include functions and have these new things called access specifiers. An access specifier is one of the following three keywords: private, public or protected. These specifiers modify the access rights for the members that follow them:\n",
    "\n",
    "* private members of a class are accessible only from within other members of the same class (or from their \"friends\"). \n",
    "* protected members are accessible from other members of the same class (or from their \"friends\"), but also from members of their derived classes. \n",
    "* Finally, public members are accessible from anywhere where the object is visible. \n",

    "## Overloading operators\n",
    "Classes, essentially, define new types to be used in C++ code. And types in C++ not only interact with code by means of constructions and assignments. They also interact by means of operators. For example, take the following operation on fundamental types:\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "int a, b, c;\n",
    "a = b + c;\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, different variables of a fundamental type (int) are applied the addition operator, and then the assignment operator. For a fundamental arithmetic type, the meaning of such operations is generally obvious and unambiguous, but it may not be so for certain class types. For example:\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "struct myclass {\n",
    "  string product;\n",
    "  float price;\n",
    "} a, b, c;\n",
    "a = b + c;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, it is not obvious what the result of the addition operation on b and c does. In fact, this code alone would cause a compilation error, since the type myclass has no defined behavior for additions. However, C++ allows most operators to be overloaded so that their behavior can be defined for just about any type, including classes. Here is a list of all the operators that can be overloaded:\n",
    "\n",
    "    +, -, *, /, %, ^, &, |, ~, !, =, <, >, <=, >=, ++, --, <<, >>, ==, !=, &&, ||, +=, -=, /=, %=, ^=, &=, |=, *=, <<=, >>=, [], (), ->, ->*, new, new [], delete, delete []\n",
    "\n",
    "Following is the list of operators, which can not be overloaded:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ::, .*, ., ?:\n",
    "\n",
    "Operators are overloaded by means of operator functions, which are regular functions with special names: their name begins by the operator keyword followed by the operator sign that is overloaded. The syntax is:\n",
    "\n",
    "    type operator sign (parameters) { /*... body ...*/ } \n",
    "    \n",
    "For example, cartesian vectors are sets of two coordinates: x and y. The addition operation of two cartesian vectors is defined as the addition both x coordinates together, and both y coordinates together. For example, adding the cartesian vectors (3,1) and (1,2) together would result in (3+1,1+2) = (4,3). This could be implemented in C++ with the following code:"
