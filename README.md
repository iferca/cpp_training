# About 

This is an interactive c++ training, created for the `A13 Software Development, c++` program in colaboration with [TBV](http://tbv.org.tr). 

## How to use

This content shaped as a set of Jupyter Notebooks, Markdown and some other static files. In order to be able to execute it the `xeus-cling` kernel is required (or any other cling based kernel in existance). To install it you'd need to follow instructions in [xeus-cling Github](https://github.com/jupyter-xeus/xeus-cling#installation). 

Some considerations:

* At the moment of writting this, there were no xeus-cling packages for Windows. 
* This was proven to work in Windows using [Windows Subsistem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
